# EasyScraper ðŸ‘Œ - <em>Ethan Ahlquist</em>

This is a script to aid my brother in webscraping data from websites. 
The goal is to edit input fields of proprietary calculator websites, 
in order to model input-output responses.

# Instructions

### Clone the Repository ðŸ”¥
```
git clone https://github.com/ethanahlquist/EasyScraper.git
```
### Get Requirements
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run Program
```
python3 ./main.py
```

### Check Websites input fields
```
python3 ./getInputs.py
```
### Edit File `userCode.py`

Editing `userCode.py` will give you control of many things:
- the target website
- the input field targets
- the way data is stored in `data.csv`
- how the program views the data.
